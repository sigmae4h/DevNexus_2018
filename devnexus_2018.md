#### Software architecture for developers
Simon Brown @10:00 - A403

1. Not big design up front
  * Usual pattern: Big design vs. Nothing
  * Don't do either - use Evolutionary Design
    * What are you building?
    * Does it work?
    * Cost of change?
2. Every team needs to think about architecture
  * Avoids chaos
  * Not a relay sport
    * Architect must be involved in whole process
    * Must have continuous technical leadership
    * Different styles of leadership for different teams
    * Pair architecting
    * Soft skills important
      * Book: Talking with Tech Leads
    * Architects write code: be involved
    * Architects should be master builders
      * Must understand technology
      * Book: Progress Toward an Engineering Dicipine of Software
3. UML is not needed
  * Think about abstractions first
  * Focus on communicating intent
  * Use map keys:
    * Systems (context)
    * Containers
    * Components
    * Classes
  * Tool: Structurizr
4. Continuous Improvement mindset
  * Enables agility
    * Microservices / modular monolith
  * Agility is a quality attribute
  * Book: Clean Architecture, Uncle Bob

#### Continuous Delivery for Data Pipelines
Sabby Anandan @11:15 - A305

1. Spring Cloud Data Flow
  * Data Integration
    * Source -> Process -> Sink
  * DSL inspired by Unix pipes and filters
  * Easy to use different technologies
  * Difficult to change properties (flow) while running
2. Spring Cloud Skipper
  * Allows real-time flow manipulation
  * Rollback supported
